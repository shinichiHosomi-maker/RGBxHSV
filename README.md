## RGBxHSV

When extracting a segment from 3D point clouds or 2D images using rule-based programs or machine learning technologies, the results sometimes do not meet my expectations. In cases where the segmentation outcome is closely tied to color information, I analyze the RGB values of both segmented and unsegmented point clouds. However, RGB values are not an intuitive expression for me. 

This app provides an easy solution by allowing me to view both RGB and HSV values simultaneously. Additionally, it is useful for modifying color thresholds in rule-based programs.
